    "他的声音很轻，却在寂静的清晨显得格外清晰。母亲没有再说什么，只是默默地将一个包袱递到他手中。\n",
    "包袱不重，但李明知道里面装着母亲所有的心意——几件换洗的衣裳，几个烙饼，还有父亲留下的那把短刀。\n",
    "\n",
    "\"路上小心。\"母亲终于开口，声音有些颤抖。\n",

    "有热情好客的农家，有精明狡猾的商人，也有孤独的旅人。每个人都有自己的故事，每个故事都让他对这个世界有了新的认识。\n",
    "\n",
    "第三天的黄昏，他来到了一个叫做青石镇的地方。镇子不大，但街道整洁，店铺林立。\n",
    "最引人注目的是镇中央的一座酒楼，名叫\"醉仙居\"，三层高的木楼在夕阳下散发着暖黄色的光芒。\n",
    "\n",
    "\"年轻人，来住店吗？\"酒楼门口的小二热情地招呼道。\n",
    "\n",
    "李明摸了摸怀里所剩不多的铜钱，犹豫了一下。这七天来，他大多睡在路边的破庙或者好心人家的柴房里。\n",
    "一顿像样的饭菜和一张温暖的床，对他来说已经是奢侈品了。\n",
    "\n",
    "\"住一晚多少钱？\"他问道。\n",

    "\"通铺吧。\"李明走了进去。\n",
    "\n",
    "酒楼里很热闹，各种各样的人聚在一起吃饭喝酒。李明找了个角落坐下，要了一碗面和一壶茶。\n",
    "邻桌坐着几个江湖模样的人，正在大声地讨论着什么。\n",
    "\n",
    "\"你们听说了吗？长安城最近出了大事！\"一个络腮胡子的大汉压低声音说道，但他的声音依然传遍了半个酒楼。\n",
    "\"什么大事？\"同桌的一个瘦高个急忙问道。\n",
    "\"据说天机阁的阁主失踪了，整个武林都在找他。\"络腮胡子神秘兮兮地说。\n",
    "\n",
    "李明的耳朵动了动。天机阁，那是他父亲生前常常提起的地方。\n",
    "\"天机阁掌控着天下武林的情报，阁主失踪，意味着很多秘密可能会被泄露。\"络腮胡子继续说道。\n",
    "\"各大门派都派了人去长安，明面上说是帮忙寻找，实际上嘛……\"他意味深长地笑了笑。\n",
    "\n",
    "李明默默地喝着面汤，心中却掀起了波澜。他去长安，本来只是为了完成父亲的遗愿。\n",
